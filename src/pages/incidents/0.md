title: Planned maintenance - 17.10.2023
---

The server will be shut down for planned maintenance today either this afternoon or evening (CEST). We are currently moving to a different host meaning we have to pull a lot of stuff to the new server including the complete database and media files. This may take a while so please be patient.

Update: Services like kopimi.space remain unaffected. Only services hosted on ServByte will be moved to the new system. If you donâ€™t know which ones are affected, please take a look at our services list linked in the navigation of this page.

Update 2: The move was successful and the server is now back online.
